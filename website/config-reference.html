				<div class="bg-blue-100 border-l-4 border-blue-500 text-blue-700 p-4 mb-4" role="alert" md>
					**Getting started?**

					This page is about all the configuration options PHPStan has. If you want to learn how to start using PHPStan, head to [Getting Started](/user-guide/getting-started) instead.
				</div>

				<div md>
					NEON format
					----------------------

					PHPStan uses configuration format called [NEON](https://ne-on.org/). It's very similar to YAML so if you're familiar with it, you can also write NEON.

					This is how a possible example of a config file can look like:
				</div>

					<pre><code class="hljs language-yaml">parameters:
	level: 6
	paths:
		- src
		- tests</code></pre>

				<h2 id="config-file">Config file</h2>

				<div md>
					A config file can be passed to the `phpstan` executable using the `-c|--configuration` option:
				</div>

				<pre><code class="hljs language-bash">vendor/bin/phpstan analyse -c phpstan.neon</code></pre>

				<div md>
					When using a config file, you have to pass the `--level|-l` option to `analyse` command (default value `0` does not apply here), or provide it as a `level` parameter in the config file itself.

					If you do not provide a config file explicitly, PHPStan will look for files named `phpstan.neon` or `phpstan.neon.dist` in current directory.

					The resolution priority is as such:

					1. If config file is provided as a command line option, it will be used.
					2. Otherwise, if `phpstan.neon` exists in the current working directory, it will be used.
					3. Otherwise, if `phpstan.neon.dist` exists in the current working directory, it will be used.
					4. If none of the above is true, no config will be used.

					The usual practice is to have `phpstan.neon.dist` under version control, and allow the user to override certain settings in their environment (on their own computer or on a continuous integration server) by creating `phpstan.neon` that's present in `.gitignore` file. See [Multiple files](#multiple-files) for more details:

				</div>

				<h2 id="multiple-files">Multiple files</h2>

				<div md>
					The NEON format supports an `includes` section to compose the final configuration from multiple files. Let's say the `phpstan.neon.dist` project config file looks like this:
				</div>

				<pre><code class="hljs language-yaml">parameters:
	level: 6
	paths:
		- src
		- tests</code></pre>

				<div md>If the user doesn't have certain PHP extensions, wants to ignore some reported errors from the analysis, and to disable parallel CPU processing, they can create `phpstan.neon` file with this content:</div>

				<pre><code class="hljs language-yaml">includes:
	- phpstan.neon.dist

parameters:
	ignoreErrors:
		- '#Function pcntl_open not found\.#'
	parallel:
		maximumNumberOfProcesses: 1</code></pre>

				<div md>
					Relative paths in the `includes` section are resolved based on the directory of the config file is in. So in this example, `phpstan.neon.dist` and `phpstan.neon` are next to each other in the same directory.
				</div>

				<h2 id="installing-extensions">Installing extensions</h2>

				<div md>
					Users can install various PHPStan extensions to enhance the capabilities of the static analyser. Many extensions already support [phpstan/extension-installer](https://github.com/phpstan/extension-installer) Composer plugin, so in order to enable an extension, it's sufficient to require it in your `composer.json`:
				</div>

				<pre><code class="hljs language-bash">composer require --dev phpstan/extension-installer && \
composer require --dev phpstan/phpstan-beberlei-assert</code></pre>

				<div md>
					If you can't or don't want to use [phpstan/extension-installer](https://github.com/phpstan/extension-installer), include the extension's configuration file manually in the `includes` section:
				</div>

				<pre><code class="hljs language-yaml">includes:
	- vendor/phpstan/phpstan-beberlei-assert/extension.neon</code></pre>

				<div class="bg-blue-100 border-l-4 border-blue-500 text-blue-700 p-4 mb-4" role="alert" md>
					**Why wouldn't I want to always use [phpstan/extension-installer](https://github.com/phpstan/extension-installer)?**

					It always enables all the functionality that an extension offers. If you for example want to use only some of the rules from [phpstan-strict-rules](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan-strict-rules), or if you only want to use `extension.neon` (but not `rules.neon`) from [phpstan-doctrine](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan-doctrine), you can't use the extension installer plugin and must include chosen files manually.
				</div>

				<h2 id="ignoring-errors">Ignoring errors</h2>

				<div md>
					Learn more about ignoring errors in the [user guide](/user-guide/ignoring-errors).
				</div>

				<h2 id="autoloading">Autoloading</h2>

				<div md>
					Learn more about autoloading in the [user guide](/user-guide/autoloading).
				</div>

				<h2 id="bootstrap">Bootstrap</h2>

				<div md>
					If you need to initialize something in PHP runtime before PHPStan runs (like your own autoloader), you can provide your own bootstrap file:
				</div>

				<pre><code class="hljs lang-yaml">parameters:
	bootstrap: phpstan-bootstrap.php</code></pre>

				<div md>
					Relative path in the `bootstrap` key is resolved based on the directory of the config file is in.
				</div>

				<h2 id="caching">Caching</h2>

				<div md>
					By default, PHPStan stores its cache files in `sys_get_temp_dir() . '/phpstan'` (usually `/tmp/phpstan`). You can override this by setting the `tmpDir` parameter:
				</div>

				<pre><code class="hljs lang-yaml">parameters:
	tmpDir: tmp</code></pre>

				<div md>
					Relative path in the `tmpDir` key is resolved based on the directory of the config file is in. In this example PHPStan cache will be stored in `tmp` directory that's next to the configuration file.
				</div>

				<h2 id="analysed-files">Analysed files</h2>

				<div md>
					PHPStan accepts a list of files and directories on the command line:
				</div>

				<pre><code class="hljs language-bash">vendor/bin/phpstan analyse -c src tests</code></pre>

				<div md>
					You can save some keystrokes each time you run PHPStan by moving the analysed paths to the config file:
				</div>

				<pre><code class="hljs lang-yaml">parameters:
	paths:
		- src
		- tests</code></pre>

				<div md>
					Relative paths in the `paths` key are resolved based on the directory of the config file is in.

					If you provide analysed paths to PHPStan on the command line and in the config file at the same time, they are not merged. Only the paths on the command line will be used.
				</div>

				<div class="bg-blue-100 border-l-4 border-blue-500 text-blue-700 p-4 mb-4" role="alert" md>
					You should only analyse files with the code you've written yourself. There's no need to analyse the `vendor` directory with 3rd party dependencies because it's not in your power to fix all the mistakes made by the developers you don't work with directly.

					Yes, PHPStan needs to know about all the classes, interfaces, traits, and functions your code uses, but that's achieved through [autoloading](/user-guide/autoloading), not by including the files in the analysis.
				</div>

				<div md>
					If your codebase contains some files that are broken on purpose (e. g. to test behaviour of your application on files with invalid PHP code), you can exclude them using the `excludes_analyse` key. Each entry is used as a pattern for the [`fnmatch()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.fnmatch.php) function.
				</div>

				<pre><code class="hljs lang-yaml">parameters:
	excludes_analyse:
		- tests/*/data/*</code></pre>

				<div md>
					By default, PHPStan analyses only files with the `.php` extension. To include other extensions, use the `fileExtensions` key:
				</div>

				<pre><code class="hljs lang-yaml">parameters:
	fileExtensions:
		- php
		- module
		- inc</code></pre>

				<h2 id="rule-level">Rule level</h2>

				<div md>
					Learn more about rule levels in the [user guide](/user-guide/rule-levels).

					Instead of using the CLI option `--level`, you can save some keystrokes each time you run PHPStan by moving the desired level to the config file:
				</div>

				<pre><code class="hljs lang-yaml">parameters:
	level: 6</code></pre>

				<h2 id="custom-ruleset">Custom ruleset</h2>

				<div md>
					PHPStan requires you to specify a level to run which means it will choose the enforced rules for you. If you don't want to follow the predefined rule levels and want to create your own ruleset, tell PHPStan to not require a level by setting `customRulesetUsed` to true:
				</div>

				<pre><code class="hljs lang-yaml">parameters:
	customRulesetUsed: true</code></pre>

				<div md>
					You can then choose your own ruleset by copying parts of the [level configuration files](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan-src/tree/master/conf) from PHPStan sources, or include your own custom rules.
				</div>

				<h2 id="solving-undefined-variables">Solving undefined variables</h2>

				<!-- todo move to user guide -->

				<div md>
					Consider this example:
				</div>

				<pre><code class="hljs language-php">if (somethingIsTrue()) {
	$foo = true;
} elseif (orSomethingElseIsTrue()) {
	$foo = false;
} else {
	$this->redirect('homepage');
}

doFoo($foo); // possibly undefined variable $foo</code></pre>

				<div md>
					Without any special knowledge we might think that the variable `$foo` might be undefined in case the `else` branch was executed. However, some specific method calls can be perceived by project developers also as early terminating - like a `redirect()` that stops execution by throwing an internal exception.

					These methods can be configured by specifying a class on whose instance they are called using `earlyTerminatingMethodCalls` option key like this:
				</div>

				<pre><code class="hljs lang-yaml">parameters:
	earlyTerminatingMethodCalls:
		Nette\Application\UI\Presenter:
			- redirect
			- redirectUrl
			- sendJson
			- sendResponse</code></pre>

				<div md>
					The same applies to plain global functions. Early terminating functions can be defined using the `earlyTerminatingFunctionCalls` key, like this one with a global helper function `redirect()`:
				</div>

				<pre><code class="hljs lang-yaml">parameters:
	earlyTerminatingFunctionCalls:
		- redirect</code></pre>

				<!-- TODO talk about isset() when PHPStan doesn't see the connection between variable value and existence -->

				<h2 id="universal-object-crates">Universal object crates</h2>

				<!-- TODO move to user guide -->

				<div md>
					Classes without predefined structure are common in PHP applications. They are used as universal holders of data - any property can be set and read on them. Notable examples include `stdClass`, `SimpleXMLElement` (these are enabled by default), objects with results of database queries etc. Use `universalObjectCratesClasses` key to let PHPStan know which classes with these characteristics are used in your codebase:
				</div>

				<pre><code class="hljs lang-yaml">parameters:
	universalObjectCratesClasses:
		- Dibi\Row
		- Ratchet\ConnectionInterface</code></pre>

				<h2 id="constants">Constants</h2>

				<div md>
					Learn more about letting PHPStan know about your global constants in [the user guide](/user-guide/autoloading).
				</div>

				<div md>
					Sometimes your constants can have different values in different environments, like `DATABASE_ENGINE` that can have different values like `mysql` or `pgsql`. To let PHPStan know that the value of the constant can be different, and prevent errors like `Strict comparison using === between 'pgsql' and 'mysql' will always evaluate to false.`, add the constant name to `dynamicConstantNames` key:
				</div>

				<pre><code class="hljs lang-yaml">parameters:
	dynamicConstantNames:
		- DATABASE_ENGINE
		- Foo::BAR_CONSTANT # class constants are also supported</code></pre>

				<h2 id="stub-files">Stub files</h2>

				<!-- TODO move to user guide -->

				<div md>
					PHPStan depends on PHPDocs in the analysed and used code. You might encounter a PHPDoc in your `vendor/` that's imprecise and causes an error in the analysis of your project that's a false positive.

					To mitigate this, you can write a stub file with the right PHPDoc. It's like source code, but PHPStan only reads PHPDocs from it. So the namespace and class/interface/trait/method/function names must match with the original source you're describing. But method bodies can stay empty, PHPStan is only interested in the PHPDocs. Get inspired by [the stubs PHPStan itself uses](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan-src/tree/master/stubs) or by [the stubs from the phpstan-doctrine extension](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan-doctrine/tree/master/stubs).
				</div>

				<div class="bg-blue-100 border-l-4 border-blue-500 text-blue-700 p-4 mb-4" role="alert" md>
					**What about the analysis of the stub files?**

					Stub files don't need to be added to the list of analysed paths. They're analysed independently of the chosen rule level with a set of select rules mainly evaluating the PHPDoc well-formedness.

					Errors reported in the stub files also can't be ignored and all of them must be fixed.
				</div>

				<div md>
					The stub file needs to be added to the `stubFiles` key:
				</div>

				<pre><code class="hljs lang-yaml">parameters:
	stubFiles:
		- stubs/Foo.stub
		- stubs/Bar.stub</code></pre>

				<div md>
					They can have any file extension you'd like. Consider choosing `.stub` over `.php` so that the stubs don't confuse your IDE.

					Relative paths in the `stubFiles` key are resolved based on the directory of the config file is in.
				</div>

				<div class="bg-orange-100 border-l-4 border-orange-500 text-orange-700 p-4 mb-4" role="alert" md>
					**Why is PHPStan complaining about "Class not found" in a stub file?**

					Stub files are analysed independently from the rest of your codebase. This means that any type they're referencing must also be present as a stub, even if you don't want to override any of its PHPDocs.

					*This is a way of tackling the problem of optional dependencies. We want to report any undefined names used in the stubs to prevent typos, but at the same time we also need to support optional dependencies in PHPStan extensions. That's why all the symbols must be defined again in the stubs, even as [empty shells](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan-phpunit/blob/26394996368b6d033d012547d3197f4e07e23021/stubs/MockObject.stub).*
				</div>

				<h2 id="stricter-analysis">Stricter analysis</h2>

				<div md>
					Existing outside of rule levels there are additional parameters affecting analysis result you can tune.

					### `polluteScopeWithLoopInitialAssignments`

					**default**: `true` ([strict-rules](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan-strict-rules) sets it to `false`)

					**example**: [with `true`](https://phpstan.org/r/23bb1a01-c802-4e60-a50a-73b9b8c3d7bf), [with `false`](https://phpstan.org/r/ad4a5198-099b-4f1a-99a5-1dd9eb9cc7c6)

					When set to `false` it prevents reading variables set in `for` loop initial statement and `while` loop condition after the loop.

					### `polluteScopeWithAlwaysIterableForeach`

					**default**: `true` ([strict-rules](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan-strict-rules) sets it to `false`)

					**example**: [with `true`](https://phpstan.org/r/daf81a57-4f06-44d5-9d76-8fa2ce937db5), [with `false`](https://phpstan.org/r/df2ac8cf-761d-4606-bdd9-46468010863d)

					When set to `false` it prevents reading key and value variables set in foreach when iterating over a non-empty array.

					### `polluteCatchScopeWithTryAssignments`

					**default**: `false`

					If you use some variables from a try block in your catch blocks, set this parameter to `true`.
				</div>

					<pre><code>try {
	$author = $this->getLoggedInUser();
	$post = $this->postRepository->getById($id);
} catch (PostNotFoundException $e) {
	// $author is probably defined here
	throw new ArticleByAuthorCannotBePublished($author);
}</code></pre>

				<div md>
					### `checkAlwaysTrueCheckTypeFunctionCall`

					**default**: `false` ([strict-rules](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan-strict-rules) sets it to `true`)

					**example**: [with `false`](https://phpstan.org/r/0630a07b-ae95-4142-8497-1e0d0e9b9a3b), [with `true`](https://phpstan.org/r/0374a4f8-25b6-47cb-af15-2c769038bf23)

					When set to `true`, it reports occurrences of type-checking functions always evaluated to true.

					### `checkAlwaysTrueInstanceof`

					**default**: `false` ([strict-rules](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan-strict-rules) sets it to `true`)

					**example**: [with `false`](https://phpstan.org/r/2911e3c4-4738-414c-81ae-46f4b3db992f), [with `true`](https://phpstan.org/r/28e463d8-a6e3-421c-8388-9a71ea8060e7)

					When set to `true`, it reports `instanceof` occurrences always evaluated to true.

					### `checkAlwaysTrueStrictComparison`

					**default**: `false` ([strict-rules](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan-strict-rules) sets it to `true`)

					**example**: [with `false`](https://phpstan.org/r/cf5b3e50-9d59-4e91-9efc-3e86600a8ac0), [with `true`](https://phpstan.org/r/83723605-0cd3-4a4e-bfb2-7971d9eb554b)

					When set to `true`, it reports `===` and `!==` occurrences always evaluated to true.

					### `checkExplicitMixedMissingReturn`

					**default**: `false` ([strict-rules](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan-strict-rules) sets it to `true`)

					**example**: [with `false`](https://phpstan.org/r/cc69160f-4c08-4e28-a210-119088381ae2), [with `true`](https://phpstan.org/r/d80c3739-bf4c-431f-abe9-3a0a37a6a13a)

					When set to `true`, it reports code paths with missing `return` statement in functions and methods with `@return mixed` PHPDoc.

					### `checkFunctionNameCase`

					**default**: `false` ([strict-rules](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan-strict-rules) sets it to `true`)

					**example**: [with `false`](https://phpstan.org/r/1d6b7920-71e5-4f69-a1fd-8e0e7ed48e28), [with `true`](https://phpstan.org/r/3b876a1a-743e-42c7-8a5e-0c143372f74b)

					When set to `true`, it reports function and method calls with incorrect name case.

					### `checkMissingClosureNativeReturnTypehintRule`

					**default**: `false` ([strict-rules](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan-strict-rules) sets it to `true`)

					**example**: [with `false`](https://phpstan.org/r/c3373d13-4ab1-443b-8e97-55c5b795b2a2), [with `true`](https://phpstan.org/r/7066aec7-ae60-45c5-ad96-08b1c3f2e5c0)

					When set to `true`, it reports closures that could have a native return typehint.

					### `reportMaybesInMethodSignatures`

					**default**: `false` ([strict-rules](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan-strict-rules) sets it to `true`)

					**example**: [with `false`](https://phpstan.org/r/34e1217e-8ac4-46b9-b753-49916ca74963), [with `true`](https://phpstan.org/r/772bbb00-21f7-4286-8856-f52f45a25c1a)

					When set to `true`, it reports violations of parameter type contravariance and return type covariance. By default, PHPStan only reports completely incompatible types in signatures, [see this example](https://phpstan.org/r/65d77b12-3421-48b4-b27c-b76a01a22f98).

					### `reportStaticMethodSignatures`

					**default**: `false` ([strict-rules](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan-strict-rules) sets it to `true`)

					**example**: [with `false`](https://phpstan.org/r/b132c693-006d-481d-a3b0-2535b3c33b5a), [with `true`](https://phpstan.org/r/8a2faef7-d64c-46f9-ada8-a68a4675c283)

					When set to `true`, it reports violations of parameter type contravariance and return type covariance in static methods.

					### `checkTooWideReturnTypesInProtectedAndPublicMethods`

					**default**: `false`

					When set to `true`, it reports return typehints that could be narrowed down because some of the listed types are never returned from a public or protected method. For [private methods](https://phpstan.org/r/45ebd3b5-3868-43b6-becc-2c31578b4b1c) PHPStan does this by default.
				</div>

				<pre><code class="hljs lang-php">public function doFoo(): ?string
{
	// Method Foo::doFoo() never returns null so it can be removed from the return typehint.
	return 'str';
}</code></pre>

				<h2 id="vague-typehints">Vague typehints</h2>

				<div md>
					[Level 6](#rule-level) checks for missing typehints. Not only it reports when there's no typehing at all, but also when it's not specific enough. PHPStan needs to know about array item types. So `array` isn't specific enough but `int[]` is.

					If you want to use level 6 to report missing typehints, but are fine with `array` instead of `int[]`, you can disable this behaviour by setting `checkMissingIterableValueType` key to false:
				</div>

				<pre><code class="hljs lang-yaml">parameters:
	checkMissingIterableValueType: false</code></pre>

				<p>
				<span md>If you're using [generics](https://medium.com/@ondrejmirtes/generics-in-php-using-phpdocs-14e7301953), another thing that level 6 does is that it requires type variables always be specified in typehints.</span> So <code>ReflectionClass</code> isn't sufficient but <code>ReflectionClass&lt;Foo&gt;</code> is.
				</p>

				<div md>
					You can disable this strict approach to generics by setting `checkGenericClassInNonGenericObjectType` key to false:
				</div>

				<pre><code class="hljs lang-yaml">parameters:
	checkGenericClassInNonGenericObjectType: false</code></pre>

				<h2 id="type-aliases">Type aliases</h2>

				<!-- TODO move to User Guide, just leave a link here -->

				<div md>
					Type aliases (also known as `typedef`) are a popular feature in other languages like TypeScript or C++. Using the following configuration in the config file will allow you to reference these types in your PHPDocs:
				</div>

				<pre><code class="hljs lang-yaml">parameters:
    typeAliases:
        Name: 'string'
        NameResolver: 'callable(): string'
        NameOrResolver: 'Name|NameResolver'</code></pre>

				<div md>Your code can look like this:</div>

				<pre><code class="hljs lang-php">/**
 * @param NameOrResolver $arg
 */
function foo($arg)
{
    // $arg is string|(callable(): string)
}</code></pre>

				<h2 id="parallel-processing">Parallel processing</h2>

				<div md>
					PHPStan runs in multiple threads by default, taking advantage of multiple cores in your CPU. It uses [a formula](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan-src/blob/a97bdead71d24694dfe2bbe96de80486119b27a1/src/Parallel/Scheduler.php#L28-L45) to figure out how many child processes to spawn. The child processes are given "jobs" - each job represents a batch of a certain number of files to process. The inputs to the formula are:

					* Auto-detected number of logical CPU cores on your system. If you have 8 physical cores and hyper-threading-enabled CPU, you have 16 logical CPU cores.
					* Maximum number of desired spawned processes, to prevent CPU hogging of the whole system if it's resource-constrained. (`parallel.maximumNumberOfProcesses`)
					* Minimum number of jobs per process. Process is spawned only if it will process at least 2 jobs by default.  (`parallel.minimumNumberOfJobsPerProcess`)
					* Job size - how many files are analysed in a single batch (`parallel.jobSize`)
					* Number of analysed files - it's different each time because of how your codebase changes, and also thanks to the [result cache](https://medium.com/@ondrejmirtes/from-minutes-to-seconds-massive-performance-gains-in-phpstan-163be88d1519).

					These variables can be changed in the configuration. Here are the defaults:
				</div>

				<pre><code class="hljs lang-yaml">parameters:
	parallel:
		jobSize: 20
		maximumNumberOfProcesses: 32
		minimumNumberOfJobsPerProcess: 2</code></pre>

				<div md>
					You might encounter this error message when running PHPStan:

					> Child process timed out after 60 seconds. Try making it longer with `parallel.processTimeout` setting.

					This can happen when a single job takes longer than the set timeout. It prevents PHPStan from running indefinitely when something unexpected occurs. In case of large files, it might be normal that the analysis of some of them takes longer. You can make the timeout longer in the configuration:
				</div>

				<pre><code class="hljs lang-yaml">parameters:
	parallel:
		processTimeout: 300.0</code></pre>

				<div md>
					To disable parallel processing altogether, set `maximumNumberOfProcesses` to `1`:
				</div>

				<pre><code class="hljs lang-yaml">parameters:
	parallel:
		maximumNumberOfProcesses: 1</code></pre>

					### `inferPrivatePropertyTypeFromConstructor`

					**default**: `false`

					When set to `true`, it doesn't require typehints for properties if the types can be inferred from constructor injection:

				</div>

				<pre><code class="lang-php">private $foo; // PHPStan infers $foo to be Foo

public function __construct(Foo $foo)
{
	$this->foo = $foo;
}
</code></pre>

				<div md>
					### `treatPhpDocTypesAsCertain`

					**default**: `true`

					**example**: [with `true`](https://phpstan.org/r/af59f2c2-9700-4c0a-9fe6-c51b70a08d43), [with `false`](https://phpstan.org/r/c7d4173c-d3ba-4857-a260-ce9cac36e399)

					PHPStan by default doesn't differentiate between PHPDoc and native types. It considers them both as certain.

					This might not be what you want in case you're writing a library whose users might pass a wrong argument type to a function. Setting `treatPhpDocTypesAsCertain` to `false` relaxes some of the rules around type-checking.

					### `tipsOfTheDay`

					**default**: `true`

					From time to time, PHPStan shows "💡 Tips of the Day" at the end of a successful analysis. You can turn this off by setting `tipsOfTheDay` key to `false`.

				<h2 id="expanding-paths">Expanding paths</h2>

				<div md>
					There are two predefined parameters usable to expand in config parameters that represent paths:

					* `%rootDir%` - root directory where PHPStan resides (i.e. `vendor/phpstan/phpstan` in Composer installation)
					* `%currentWorkingDirectory%` - current working directory where PHPStan was executed

					These are no longer very useful as all relative paths in config parameters are resolved based on the directory of the config file is in, resulting in a short and concise notation.

					Consider this directory structure:
				</div>

				<pre><code class="hljs nohighlight">app/
  model/
  ui/
    Foo.php
build/
  phpstan.neon
src/
tests/
vendor/</code></pre>

				<div md>
					To reference the `Foo.php` file from `phpstan.neon`, you can simply use `../app/ui/Foo.php`.

					To reference the `Foo.php` involving `%rootDir%`, you'd have to use `%rootDir%/../../../app/ui/Foo.php` which isn't really nice.
				</div>

				<h2 id="custom-parameters">Custom parameters</h2>

				<!-- TODO add link to Developing Extensions -->

				<div md>
					When developing custom PHPStan extensions, you might need a custom config parameter to provide customization to the user.

					PHPStan does not allow unknown parameters to be present in the config in order to prevent typos. Any new parameter also needs to be added to the top-level `parametersSchema` section of the config file.

					The schema is defined using [nette/schema](https://github.com/nette/schema) library. Definition of some of the built-in PHPStan parameters looks like this:
				</div>

				<pre><code class="hljs lang-yaml">parametersSchema:
	earlyTerminatingMethodCalls: arrayOf(listOf(string()))
	earlyTerminatingFunctionCalls: listOf(string())
	memoryLimitFile: string()
	staticReflectionClassNamePatterns: listOf(string())
	dynamicConstantNames: listOf(string())
	customRulesetUsed: bool()</code></pre>

				<div md>If your parameters are nested arrays, you need to use the `structure` keyword:</div>

				<pre><code class="hljs lang-yaml">parametersSchema:
	symfony: structure([
		container_xml_path: schema(string(), nullable())
		constant_hassers: bool()
		console_application_loader: schema(string(), nullable())
	])</code></pre>
			</div>
		</div>
	</block>
</extends>
