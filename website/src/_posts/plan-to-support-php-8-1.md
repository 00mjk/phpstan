For the past few years PHPStan [always](/blog/phpstan-now-fully-supports-php-7-4) had [support](/blog/phpstan-is-ready-for-php8) for the latest PHP version on day one, and I considered a matter of pride to achieve that.

Today marks the new PHP 8.1 release that [contains a lot of cool new features](https://stitcher.io/blog/new-in-php-81) which I'm really excited about. Unfortunately, unlike the past releases, PHPStan isn't fully ready for them yet. This is because the whole fall season I've been really busy with the massive [PHPStan 1.0 release](/blog/phpstan-1-0-released).

So what's the current situation? Since 1.0 PHPStan was able to run on PHP 8.1 without triggering any deprecations or other issues, but you couldn't take advantage of the new PHP 8.1 features.

[PHPStan 1.1](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan/releases/tag/1.1.0) brought support for the native `never` type, pure intersection types, and tentative return types.

[PHPStan 1.2](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan/releases/tag/1.2.0) brought support for `new` in initializers, first-class callables, and the `array_is_list()` function.

What remains to be implemented are new rules for `readonly` properties, update [stubs](https://github.com/phpstan/php-8-stubs) of changed function signatures, some miscellaneous things, and [enums](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/enumerations).

While all the other features were a mere checklist items, enums are a project. A big project. The todolist now consists of approximately 40 items. It's now my priority to finish support for enums and I expect to work on it throughout the whole month of December. It's possible that at some point during development I'll consider the support as not complete, but sufficient, and release something half-way so that developers eager to use enums in their codebase can take advantage of them as soon as possible.
